## About

I am a first-year PhD Student in Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/). My research focuses on natural language processing and machine learning, specifically developing robust models for 
grounded language understanding. My goal is to build agents that can collaborate effectively with humans and act safely
in different environments. I am grateful to be supported by the [Open Philanthropy Project AI Fellowship](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/the-open-phil-ai-fellowship#Class).

Before starting at Stanford, I was a Resident at [Facebook AI Research](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/) in New York, where
I was lucky to get to work with [Rob Fergus](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/pmwiki/pmwiki.php), 
[Arthur Szlam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u3-FxUgAAAAJ&hl=en), 
[Douwe Kiela](https://douwekiela.github.io/), and [Jason Weston](http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/) on problems in grounded language understanding
and reinforcement learning. 

I received my undergraduate degree from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) in May 2018, where I concentrated in 
Computer Science and Literary Arts. While at Brown, I did research in natural language processing and human-robot 
interaction advised by [Eugene Charniak](http://cs.brown.edu/people/echarnia/) and [Stefanie Tellex](http://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/).

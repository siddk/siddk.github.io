## About

I am a Resident at [Facebook AI Research](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/) in New York
and an incoming PhD Student in Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/).

I received my undergraduate degree from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) in May 2018, where I concentrated in 
Computer Science and Literary Arts. While at Brown, I did research in natural language processing and human-robot 
interaction advised by [Eugene Charniak](http://cs.brown.edu/people/echarnia/) and [Stefanie Tellex](http://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/).

My research focuses on natural language processing and machine learning, specifically developing robust models for 
grounded language understanding. My goal is to build agents that can collaborate effectively with humans and act safely
in different environments.

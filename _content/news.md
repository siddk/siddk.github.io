- **[May 2023]**: We're organizing the [2nd Workshop on Learning from Diverse, Offline Data (L-DOD)](https://sites.google.com/view/ldod2023/home) at [ICRA 2023](https://www.icra2023.org/). Happy to keep this awesome workshop going for
another year in a row! See y'all in London!

- **[February 2023]:** Introducing **Voltron**! Check out our paper on ["Language-Driven Representation Learning for Robotics"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12766); we show that we can use language supervision to learn general visual 
representations for *multiple* robotics tasks (e.g., grasp segmentation, intent inference, learning for control, amongst others). Our [models and pretraining code](https://github.com/siddk/voltron-robotics) are open-source,
as well as our [diverse evaluation suite](https://github.com/siddk/voltron-evaluation). 

- **[January 2023]:** We'll be presenting our work ["No, to the Right" â€“ Online Language Corrections for Robotic Manipulation via Shared Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02555) at the [ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI)](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2023/). 
More work on building viable systems with language and shared autonomy, co-led by [Yuchen Cui](https://web.stanford.edu/~yuchenc/), with our amazing mentees [Raj Palleti](https://github.com/rajsr-p), Nidhya Shivakumar, and my advisors [Percy](https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/) and [Dorsa](https://dorsa.fyi/). See y'all in Stockholm!

- **[December 2022]:** [Dorsa](https://dorsa.fyi/) and I gave a joint talk on ["Bridging Language and Robotics for Interaction, Learning, and Teaching"](/assets/slides/larel22.pdf) at the
[Language and Reinforcement Learning Workshop @ NeurIPS 2022 (LaReL @ NeurIPS)](https://larel-workshop.github.io/). This was a really fun and great experience, covering our work on [Language-Informed Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03205),
[Exploration through Learned Language Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05825) as well as some upcoming work!

- **[October 2022]:** Our paper ["Eliciting Compatible Demonstrations for Multi-Human Imitation Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08073) with [Kanishk Gandhi](https://www.kanishkgandhi.com/), [Madeline Liao](https://madelineliao.com/),
and [Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/) was accepted to the [Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2022](https://corl2022.org/). Really excited about what this work means for scaling robotics data collection; it was great chatting with y'all in New Zealand!

- **[September 2022]:** We've recently seen an explosion of pretrained "foundation models" applied to a series
of tasks across NLP and Vision - but how can they help improve "decision-making" (control, planning, interaction & collaboration)? 
Check out our workshop [Foundation Models for Decision Making](https://sites.google.com/view/fmdm-neurips/) at [NeurIPS 2022](https://nips.cc/) -- deadline is **October 3rd**!

- **[July 2022]:** We organized the [Workshop on Learning from Diverse, Offline Data (L-DOD)](https://sites.google.com/view/l-dod-rss2022)
at [Robotics: Science and Systems 2022 in NYC](https://roboticsconference.org/). Catch the [workshop recording on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHXp6j6YrY4)!

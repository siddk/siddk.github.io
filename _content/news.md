- **[October 2022]:** Our paper ["Eliciting Compatible Demonstrations for Multi-Human Imitation Learning"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iRabxvK3j0) with Kanishk Gandhi, Madeline Liao,
and Dorsa Sadigh was accepted to the [Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2022](https://corl2022.org/). Really excited about what this work means scalable data collection for robotics; come chat with us
in New Zealand!

- **[September 2022]:** We've recently seen an explosion of pretrained "foundation models" applied to a series
of tasks across NLP and Vision - but how can they help improve "decision-making" (control, planning, interaction & collaboration)? 
Check out our workshop [Foundation Models for Decision Making](https://sites.google.com/view/fmdm-neurips/) at [NeurIPS 2022](https://nips.cc/) -- deadline is **October 3rd**!

- **[July 2022]:** We organized the [Workshop on Learning from Diverse, Offline Data (L-DOD)](https://sites.google.com/view/l-dod-rss2022)
at [Robotics: Science and Systems 2022 in NYC](https://roboticsconference.org/). Catch the [workshop recording on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHXp6j6YrY4)!

- **[May 2022]:** Stoked to be presenting our new paper [LILAC: Shared Autonomy for Robotic Manipulation with Language
 Corrections](/assets/papers/nlsupervision22.pdf) at the [NL Supervision Workshop](https://sites.google.com/princeton.edu/nl-supervision) 
 at [ACL 2022 in Dublin](https://www.2022.aclweb.org/). First in-person NLP conference of my PhD - see y'all there!

- **[November 2021]:** Incredibly proud to have presented our paper ["LILA: Language-Informed Latent Actions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03205) 
at the [Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2021](https://www.robot-learning.org/) in London. This is my first language
 & shared autonomy paper, jointly authored with [Megha Srivastava](https://web.stanford.edu/~meghas/), with my advisors
 [Percy Liang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/) and [Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/).

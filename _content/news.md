- **[June 2022]:** We're organizing the [Workshop on Learning from Diverse, Offline Data](https://sites.google.com/view/l-dod-rss2022)
at [Robotics: Science and Systems 2022 in NYC](https://roboticsconference.org/). We have some awesome speakers and
 paper submissions are still open until May 19th!

- **[May 2022]:** Stoked to be presenting our new paper [LILAC: Shared Autonomy for Robotic Manipulation with Language
 Corrections](/assets/papers/nlsupervision22.pdf) at the [NL Supervision Workshop](https://sites.google.com/princeton.edu/nl-supervision) 
 at [ACL 2022 in Dublin](https://www.2022.aclweb.org/). First in-person NLP conference of my PhD - see y'all there!

- **[January 2022]:** The [S4 architecture for sequence modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396) is incredibly
 cool, though a bit nonintuitive. To address this, [Sasha Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/) and I wrote [The Annotated S4](https://srush.github.io/annotated-s4/) 
 a blog post and [library](https://github.com/srush/annotated-s4/) to serve as a companion to the original work
 by [Albert Gu](http://web.stanford.edu/~albertgu/) and [Karan Goel](https://krandiash.github.io/)!

- **[November 2021]:** Incredibly proud to have presented our paper ["LILA: Language-Informed Latent Actions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03205) 
at the [Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2021](https://www.robot-learning.org/) in London. This is my first language
 & shared autonomy paper, jointly authored with [Megha Srivastava](https://web.stanford.edu/~meghas/), with my advisors
 [Percy Liang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/) and [Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/).

- **[October 2021]:** Thrilled to announce that I've joined [Hugging Face ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/) as a part-time
research intern, while working towards my PhD. I'm working with [Victor Sanh](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=6STg_7IAAAAJ&hl=fr), 
[Sasha Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/), [Douwe Kiela](https://douwekiela.github.io/), and many others on multimodality and
scaling.
